# Jarvis - Voice Assistant

Jarvis is a simple voice-controlled AI assistant built with Python.  
It listens for a wake word ("Jarvis"), then responds to voice commands like:
- "Open Google"
- "Open YouTube"
- "Play [song name]"

Jarvis uses speech recognition, text-to-speech, and a custom music library.
